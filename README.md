# Uncommon Python Function Bug

This repository demonstrates a Python function that contains an uncommon bug. The bug doesn't always cause an exception but can lead to unexpected or incorrect results depending on the input values. The issue relates to implicit type conversions and potential floating-point errors.

## Bug Description

The `function_with_uncommon_bug` function is designed to perform addition or return an operand if one is zero, but its behavior with floating-point numbers near zero or unusual input combinations might be unpredictable.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.py`.
3. Observe the output. Certain input values can produce unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version of the function, addressing potential pitfalls and improving robustness and clarity.

## Note

This bug showcases how edge cases and implicit data type conversions in programming can introduce subtle and hard-to-detect errors.
